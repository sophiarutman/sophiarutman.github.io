<button style="margin-top: 30px; width: auto; height: auto; border-radius:15px; background-color: #87CEFA;"><h2>Sports Betting and Tribal Gambling</h2></button>

<p>As part of this project, my peer and I webscraped data from across the nation on tribal and commercial gambling to find connections between sports betting and tribal gambling. Although we ran into a few roadblocks, mostly related to a lack of data reporting on tribal gambling revenue, we did find success in implementing a few hypothesis tests and supervised/unsupervised learning techniques. This site explains our methodology and findings! </p>

<button style="width: auto; height: auto; border-radius:15px; background-color: #87CEFA;"><h2>Capitol to Capital: Using Lobbying Data as a Technical Indicator</h2></button>

<p>As part of my Financial Machine Learning course from Bowdoin College, two peers and I created a Lobbying indicator for the S&P500. The goal was to use this indicator, as well as RSI and MACD, to implement successful reinforcement learning techniques. In other words, using Tabular and Deep Q Learning Agents, we wanted to make as much money as possible over time. The Read Me in our repo explains our methodology and findings!</p>

<button style="width: auto; height: auto; border-radius:15px; background-color: #87CEFA;"><h2>Creating a Batting Order</h2></button>

<p>Using Ruby, my peer and I created software that generates a batting lineup, where the user inputs a player's name, OBP, BA, SLG, and OPS. It's a simple interface and serves a simple purpose, but it is very fun to mess around with! Put in nine players of your choosing and see where they would fall in our ideal batting lineup!</p>
