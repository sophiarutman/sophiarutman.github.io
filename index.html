<h2> About me</h2>

I am a graduate student at Georgetown University earning an MS in Data Science and Analytics. I completed my BA at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, graduating in 2024 with degrees in Physics and Computer Science. I also completed a minor in Education. As part of my Computer Science major, I completed an Advanced Independent Study with Professor Sarah Harmon on the intersection between LLMs and entertainment, after which I presented my findings to the International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling. I also completed two summers of Software Test Engineering at Freddie Mac and Paramount Global. At Bowdoin, I was a member of the Varsity Field Hockey and Women’s Lacrosse teams during her undergraduate years, serving as captain of the field hockey team her senior year. This love of sports has driven me to work with various teams at Georgetown on their operations teams. I want to translate the skills she has learned throughout her time at Georgetown and Bowdoin into a profession in sports analytics.
